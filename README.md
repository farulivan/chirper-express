# Chirper API

Welcome to Chirper, a lightweight Twitter-like API designed for learning and development. Built with Express.js and Node.js, Chirper lets users share their thoughts through "chirps" in a simple and efficient manner. This project not only explores the basics of API development but also dives into advanced topics like raw SQL queries, Docker, GitHub Actions, and the Service Repository Pattern.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Engage with basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality. Users can post, view, edit, and delete chirps.
- **Raw SQL Queries**: Experience the power of direct database manipulation with raw SQL, providing deep insights into database management.
- **Docker Integration**: With Docker, setting up your development and production environments has never been easier, ensuring consistency across various stages.
- **GitHub Actions for CI/CD**: Automate your development workflows with GitHub Actions.
- **Service Repository Pattern**: Chirper implements the Service Repository Pattern, separating the business logic from the data access layers. This pattern enhances the code's maintainability, scalability, and testability by decoupling components.

## Getting Started

To explore Chirper, start by cloning this repository. You'll need Node.js, Docker, and an SQL database ready on your machine.
